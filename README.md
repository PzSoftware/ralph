# Ralph Chat

Ralph is a chat app built with Meteor. I built this app at the end of 2013 to help me learn Meteor. Please note that this was my first Meteor app, and I didn't necessarily know what I was doing at the time. Basically, best practices were not always followed, there will be bugs, yada yada.

## Requirements

- Meteor >= v0.8.2

## Setup

1. Install meteor with "curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh".
2. Clone the Ralph repository, and change into the new directory.
3. Run "./meteor.sh run".
4. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to Sign Up and explore the app!

## Main Features

1. Responsive design, works on mobile and desktop.
2. Local channels automatically figure out where you are, and create a local chat room for you and anybody else in the radius shown on the local map.
3. Global channels let you create chat rooms for any topic.
4. Themed channels.
5. Flag messages.
6. iOS version, add images to your messages.
7. iOS version, toggle push notifications on/off on a per channel basis.

## iOS App

Ralph can be run as an iOS app, and includes a number of features that take advantage of native
hardware. Check out the PhoneGap app at [https://github.com/marbemac/ralph-mobile](https://github.com/marbemac/ralph-mobile).
